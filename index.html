    <h1>I'm Domino Weir. Yes, that's my real name.</h1>
    <h3>I study electrical and computer engineering at The University of Texas at Austin (hook 'em).</h3>
    <h3>I spend most of my time coding and it's only made me a little crazy.</h3>
    <h3>I am currently a senior- it's really weird and I'm trying not to think about it.</h3>
    <h3>I live in Austin, Texas, but right now I'm in Pleasanton, California.</h3>
    <h3>I work at Workday, where they let me play with computers all day.</h3>
    <h3>I work on IoT research for Dr. Christine Julien, because sometimes one job just isn't enough.</h3>
    <h3>I used to work at Applied Research Laboratories doing cool stuff that I can't talk about.</h3>
    <h3>I dance with an Irish dance group in Austin to keep me sane (I also built their <a href="http://www.irishdanceaustin.com/">website</a>).</h3>
    <h3>I have a cat. His name is Leonardo di Catrio, and he's kind of a jerk.</h3>
    <h3>I was named after a Van Morrison song, in case you were wondering.</h3>
