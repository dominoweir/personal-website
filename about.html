      <div class="modal-body row">
          <p>    Hi. I'm Domino. I'm 22 years old and a first year master's student at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I'm studying computer science,
          with an emphasis on human-computer interaction. I also just graduated with a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University
          of Texas at Austin (hook 'em). Right now, I'm working at a startup called <a href="https://www.groopeze.com/">Groopeze</a> in Dublin, Ireland as their technology intern. Dublin may seem
          like a random place for an American to spend their summer, but it's all possible through a program called Sage Corps that matches
          talented students to startups around the world.

      <div class="modal-body row">
          <p>    Before I worked at Groopeze, I spent a summer at Workday as a software engineering intern on the Payroll Core team in Pleasanton, California. I worked in a proprietary language
          called XpressO to create new tasks for payroll administrators that use the product. Before that, I worked for 10 months as a software
          technician at Applied Research Laboratories, a military research facility, in their Space and Geophysics Lab.
          In that role, I removed hardcoding and added flexibility to an existing software application by updating methods of data handling. ARL is a Department of Defense
          facility, so I have to be vague about what I did- I promise it was really cool! You can find my resume <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_SfkaHAvZHMeJgaFrga7dtrRXyAl3KvY/view?usp=sharing">here</a>
          if you want to know more about the other things I've done, such as teaching and research. I've also worked on some fun side
          projects and class assignments, more about those on my <a href="https://github.com/dominoweir">Github</a> if you're interested.

          <p>    Like most engineers, I sometimes do stuff that's not engineering to keep myself sane. Right now, that stuff is mostly Irish dancing and
          art. I've been Irish dancing since I was about 8 years old. I compete pretty regularly and attend dance classes 3 or
          4 times a week. It sounds like a lot, but after sitting at a desk all day it's nice to just go pound it all out at the studio.
          I also enjoy spending quality time with my cat, Leonardo di Catrio. He's mostly an unconscionable jerk,
          but he has his moments.
