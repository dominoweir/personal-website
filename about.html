          <p>    Hi. I'm Domino. I'm 22 years old and a first year master's student at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I'm studying computer science,
          with an emphasis on human-computer interaction. I also just graduated with a degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University
          of Texas at Austin (hook 'em). Right now, I'm working at a startup called Groopeze in Dublin, Ireland as their technology intern. Dublin may seem
          like a random place for an American to spend their summer, but it's all possible through a program called Sage Corps that matches
          talented students to startups around the world.

          <p>    Before I worked at Groopeze, I spent a summer at Workday as a software engineering intern on the Payroll Core team in Pleasanton, California. I worked in a proprietary language
          called XpressO to create new tasks for payroll administrators that use the product. Before that, I worked as a software
          technician at Applied Research Laboratories in the Space and Geophysics Lab, where I spent 10 months developing a feature for an ongoing project.
          In that role, I removed hardcoding and added flexibility to an existing software application by updating methods of data handling. The data storage
          technique I implemented is now under review to become the national standard for the government agency it was built for. ARL is a Department of Defense
          facility, so I have to be super vague about what I did- I promise it was really cool though. You can find my resume <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwOvqtYr5BmDUWthVjI4MDVuTlE/view?usp=sharing">here</a>
          if you want to know more about the cool stuff I've worked on. I've also worked on some fun side projects that are not directly related to my
          professional experience, more about those on my <a href="https://github.com/dominoweir">Github</a> if you're interested.

          <p>    Like most engineers, I sometimes do stuff that's not engineering to keep myself sane. Right now, that stuff is mostly Irish dancing and
          art. I've been Irish dancing since I was about 8 years old. I compete pretty regularly and attend dance classes 3 or
          4 times a week. It sounds like a lot, but after sitting at a desk all day it's nice to just go dance it all out at the studio.
          I also enjoy spending quality time with my cat, Leonardo di Catrio. He's mostly an unconscionable jerk,
          but he has his moments.
