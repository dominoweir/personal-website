      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p></p>
      <p>    Hi. I'm Domino. I'm 21 years old and a senior at The University of Texas at Austin. I'm studying Electrial and Computer Engineering,
          which is a fancy way of saying that I'm really in to computers. My primary areas of study are software engineering and information studies.
          I will be graduating in May of 2018, then attending graduate school to earn my PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I think it goes
          without saying that I spend most of my time studying, but I have a lot of other interests too. I spent the past two semesters working as
          a teaching assistant for Computer Architecture and Embedded Systems, and will hopefully return to TAing Computer Architecture in the fall.
          Education is one of the things I am most passionate about, so I'm really excited for that opportunity. I also work in the Mobile and
          Pervasive Computing Lab as a research assistant for Dr. Christine Julien. Right now we're working on building a smart home simulator (more about
          that on my <a href="blog.html">blog</a>).
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>    Like I said, I'm really in to computers. Sometimes, people pay me to work with computers, so that's pretty cool. Most recently this happened
          at Workday, where I worked as an Software Engineering intern on the Payroll Core team in Pleasanton, California. Before that, I worked as a software
          technician at Applied Research Laboratories in the Space and Geophysics Lab, where I spent 10 months developing a feature for an ongoing project.
          ARL is a Department of Defense facility, so I have to be super vague about what I did- I promise it was really cool though. You can download my
          resume <a href="files/resume.pdf">here</a> if you want to know more about the cool stuff I've worked on. I've also worked on some fun side projects
          that are not directly related to my professional experience, more about those on my <a href="blog.html">blog</a> if you're interested.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <p>    Like most engineers, I sometimes do stuff that's not engineering to keep myself sane. Right now, that stuff is mostly Irish dancing and
          my sorority, Chi Beta Delta. I've been Irish dancing since I was about 8 years old. I compete pretty regularly and attend dance classes 3 or
          4 times a week. As for my sorority, I am proud to serve as Chi Beta Delta's Chief Judicial Officer this year, which means I am in charge of
          enforcing our constitution. We are a sorority that focuses primarily on community service, so I also spend a lot of time volunteering in the
          greater Austin area. I also enjoy spending quality time with my cat, Leonardo di Catrio. He's a total jerk and a very badly behaved animal,
          but the little dude has his moments.
